In this thesis, the use cases outlined in the @Use_cases document have been
implemented. To ensure timely completion within the established timeframe, a
project schedule has been developed. The choice of utilizing the Waterfall
project management methodology is based on the specific characteristics of this
thesis project.

The Waterfall methodology has been selected as a suitable approach due to
several key factors. 
- the project is being conducted independently,
- without the involvement of a team, making the linear and sequential nature of
  Waterfall a practical fit.
- the project operates within strict time constraints
- the thesis description has already been submitted in advance, precluding any
  changes to the requirements.

Therefore, the Waterfall methodology aligns well with the project's unique circumstances.
