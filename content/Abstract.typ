In this thesis, a microservice is developed that allows replaying messages in a
RabbitMQ stream. To find the most suitable technology for this task, a high
level overview of the AMQP protocol is made and the most popular protocol
implementations in Java, Go and Rust are compared. The microservice is published
as a docker image and can be easily integrated into existing systems.
