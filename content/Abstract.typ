In this thesis a microservice is developed that allows replaying messages in a
RabbitMQ stream. To find the most suitable technology for this task, a high
level overview of the amqp protocol is made and the most popular protocol
implementations in java, go and rust are compared. The microservice is published
as a docker image and can be easily integrated into existing systems.
